## svd_axis_angle
A set of scripts to determine the rotation characeristics of translocation intermediates in a pairwise fashion.
Measure the 3-dimensional distance between rRNA residues of two structures.
Determine the rotational axis and rotation vectors (between phosphates for instance) between two intermediate states.
