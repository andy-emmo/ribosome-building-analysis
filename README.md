# ribosome-building-analysis
Code used in the study: "Insights into Translocation Mechanism and Ribosome Evolution from Cryo-EM Structures of Translocation-Intermediates of Giardia intestinalis."

## svd_axis_angle
A set of scripts to determine the rotation characeristics of translocation intermediates in a pairwise fashion.
Measure the 3-dimensional distance between rRNA residues of two structures.
Determine the rotational axis and rotation vectors (between phosphates for instance) between two intermediate states.
Compare rotational axes between transitions.

3-dimensional distance between rRNA residues from one translocation intermediate to another (left) with the small subunit (SSU) body residues aligned (right).

Comparison of ratcheting and rolling rotational axes for Giardia translocation intermediates.

## coot_progressive_refinement
A script to perform real space refinement in Coot using a docked structure. This script orders the residues to be refined by their distance from the (macro)molecule's centre of mass. Then it performs this refinement in a step-wise fashion in a sphere of a given radius (determined by the user, some choices in the Coot menu are 8 and 25 Ã…).
